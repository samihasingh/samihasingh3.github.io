Language is a fundamental aspect of human communication, and it is constantly evolving over time. The NGramMap project aimed to provide a web-based tool for visualizing the historical popularity of words and word lists. The tool utilized text handlers and 30% of Google's NGram dataset to create interactive visualizations of word popularity over time.

To begin, Java packages were designed and implemented for the project, using text handlers to extract data from the NGram dataset. The dataset contains a vast amount of data, so only 30% of the dataset was used to optimize the tool's performance.

The tool's web-based interface was created to allow users to visualize the relative historical popularity of words and word lists. The interface allows users to enter a word or phrase and see how its usage has changed over time. Users can also compare the popularity of multiple words or phrases in a single graph. They are also able to specify a range of years to compare relative historical popularity for.

One of the primary goals of this project was to ensure high-quality functionality and mitigate technical risks. Extensive Junit testing was conducted, with over 45 tests performed to ensure that the tool was functioning correctly and accurately. This helped to identify and address any technical issues before releasing the tool to the public.

The NGramMap tool provides a unique perspective on the evolution of language over time. By visualizing word popularity trends, users can gain insights into how language usage has changed over time and how it may continue to evolve in the future.

In conclusion, the NGramMap project was a valuable contribution to the field of linguistics and language analysis. By creating a web-based tool for visualizing historical word popularity trends, this project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the evolution of language over time. The tool's interactive interface and high-quality functionality make it a valuable resource for researchers, linguists, and language enthusiasts alike.
